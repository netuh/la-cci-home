						<h5><i>Title</i>: Extracting New Science from Data - Challenges and Opportunities</h5>
						<p> <i>Abstract</i>: There has been a very fruitful cross-fertilisation between AI and a variety of scientific disciplines. In this talk I will outline the main challenges, as well as opportunities such truly cross-disciplinary work opens up. In particular, we need a consistent mathematical framework in which to formulate learning in the space of scientific theories, as opposed to learning in the usual data spaces that take the form of finite-dimensional vector spaces, or graph data. A suggestion for such a theoretical framework will be provided, along with examples of its use in cognitive neuroscience, bio-medical sciences and astrophysics.</p>
