					LA-CCI is an acronym that refers to the Latin America Conference on Computational Intelligence (CI), which currently includes correspondents in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In these Countries, there is sound research and active groups working in CI that are eager to develop the area and exchange experiences/personnel. As well as a Conference Series, LA-CCI is a structuring endeavor from LA-CIS (Latin American Computational Intelligence Society) that is encouraging research groups of these participating Countries to teams up around the exciting topic of Computational Intelligence.

                    The eighth LA-CCI will be held in Montevideo, Uruguay at the Universidad de la República (UDELAR), in November 23 – 25 of 2022. LACCI-2022 will be held jointly with the IEEE CIS Summer School on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IEEE CIS SSoCIA 2022). Montevideo is southernmost capital city in the Americas and largest city of Uruguay. It has a population of more than 1,300,000 habitants. Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the Río de la Plata. The 2017 Mercer’s report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry in Uruguay currently represents approximately 2.5% of GDP. Montevideo represents the most important hub of the ICT industry in Uruguay, with most of the companies installed in the metropolitan area of Montevideo. Several areas of the software industry sector that are developed in Uruguay are closely related to LA-CCI conference topics of interest including business intelligence, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. UDELAR is the leading institution of higher education and research in Uruguay. In collaboration with a wide range of institutional and social actors, it also performs multiple activities aimed at socially valuable use of the knowledge and dissemination of culture. It is a public institution, autonomous and governed by its teachers, students, and graduates. It was created in 1849, and until 1985 it was the only university in Uruguay. Nowadays it has about 140.000 students in Montevideo and other regions of the country. About 80% of all the scientific research in Uruguay is produced by the Universidad de la República, which has also an important public role as an advisor to Parliament, Government, and in general to public and private institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the objective of LA-CCI Series is to provide a high-level international stage and forum for scientists, researchers, engineers, and educators to disseminate their latest research results and exchange views of the future research directions on Neural & Learning Systems, Fuzzy & Stochastic Modeling, Evolutionary & Swarm Computation, and their related applications. This year we will include a special topic on Social and economic development through Computational Intelligence technologies (including Ethical and Sustainable applications). Every year the LA-CCI crowd visits Latin Countries to talk about Computational Intelligence. Past previous successful editions of LA-CCI were: 2021 – Temuco, Chile; 2019 – Guayaquil, Ecuador; 2018 – Guadalajara/Mexico; 2017 – Arequipa/Peru; 2016 – Cartagena de Indias/Colombia; 2015 – Curitiba/Brazil; and in 2014 – San Carlos de Bariloche/Argentina. Since 2016, LA-CCI is officially sponsored by the prestigious IEEE and IEEE-CIS, and always has been supported by national government and local societies. Since its inception, the local organizers of LA-CCI and Steering Committee of LA-CCI have been caring greatly about future researchers so that this year we will offer again thematic sessions, school, and discussions-panels specially tailored for them. And as an additional self-imposed responsibility, the organizers found important to gather scholars, government officials and funding agencies representatives to discuss institutional approaches, internationalization policies and funding mechanisms that could be fostering R&D in CI for Latin American Countries. The joint organization team would like to encourage the participation of established scientists, young researchers, and advanced students, not limited of Latin America Countries. It is important to notice that our Congress is organized by Latin Countries but aims at the international scientific community. Finally, it is always worth to state our main goals, namely:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To be a notch scientific forum in Latin America;</li>
                    <li>To be a regional hub of CI practitioners and professionals;</li>
                    <li>To be a privileged showcase of CI to industry;</li>
                    <li>To be a springboard for students;</li>
                    <li>To publicize CI research going on within LA-CCI Countries;</li>
                    <li>To encourage CI research links to the LA-CCI Countries;</li>
                    <li>To foster academic mobility in LA-CCI and beyond; and,</li>
                    <li>To promote Science & Culture for Latin America.</li>
