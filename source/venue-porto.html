				<p>
					According to history the town was called Porto Rico (Rich Port) until 1850 when it became a place where people traded slaves to work in the plantations of sugar cane. To evade the control of the illegal transaction, slaves were transported together with guineafowl and passwords were created by traffickers (Portuguese: "Tem galinha nova no porto"â€”"There are new chickens in the port"), hence the origin of the name.
