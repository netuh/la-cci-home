					Porto de Galinhas is a major tourist destination. The beach is famous for its bright-water beaches
					and the natural pools. Porto de Galinhas is a beach located in the municipality of Ipojuca, in the state of Pernambuco,
					Brazil. The region has clear and warm water pools formed between corals, in addition to estuaries,
					mangroves, white sand, and coconut trees. The entire region is very popular among tourists and
					surfers of different nationalities. Every year it receives over 720,000 tourists. The region is also
					rich in gastronomic, sports, ecological and cultural experiences and has a top quality hotel
					infrastructure, with more than 13,000 beds distributed in hotels, inns and resorts. Elected for ten
					consecutive times the best beach in the country by “Viagem & Turismo” magazine, Porto de Galinhas is
					also the fifth most sought after destination in Brazil for tourism.
				</p>
				<p>
					Between Porto de Galinhas and Praia dos Carneiros (another important tourist destination in
					Pernambuco), there is the island of Santo Aleixo. Towards the north there are the beaches of Muro
					Alto, formed by an extensive barrier of reefs, and Calhetas, much visited for the practice of zip
					lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are sunny days in all months of the year, but the best time is from September to February, and
					the months with the most sunshine are October, November, and December.

				<h2>BEACHES</h2>
				<div class="description-one">
					<p>
						PORTO DE GALINHAS
						Elected ten consecutive times as the best beach in Brazil by "Viagem & Turismo" magazine, Porto
						de Galinhas is the center of everything and it is the most popular beach in the region. Its 4 km
						of white and beaten sand, coconut trees, and warm waters also bring together the entire
						infrastructure of bars, restaurants, supermarkets, and handicraft shops that work even after
						midnight in high season on streets that only circulate pedestrians. The beach hits are the
						natural pools, where the people feel like being inside an aquarium of transparent waters and
						full of colorful fish. The pools' differential is their proximity to the coast (a five-minute
						journey on rafts that depart from the center of the village), which makes them the easiest to
						reach in the entire Northeast of Brazil.
					</p>
					<p>
						BORETE
						Borete is located between the Vila and the hotels. Without the protection of reefs and with
						higher waves, the region is very popular with surfers.
					</p>
					<p>
						CACIMBAS
						Cacimbas is the name of a container to store water. On this beach, it is materialized in a
						natural pool of transparent water, surrounded by reefs, which are situated a few steps from the
						chair or umbrella. This makes Cacimbas a perfect place for swimming at low tide. In some places,
						the waves are stronger and attract surfers. Cacimbas also have caves carved into a rock bank by
						the force of the sea. It is worth bringing a mask and snorkel to see this masterpiece of nature.
						Access to Cacimbas must be done by the seaside in a 3 km walk, from Serrambi, on foot or by
						buggy.
					</p>
					<p>
						CAMBOA
						The sound of wind and waves. That's all you can hear on this semi-deserted beach of white sand,
						which has a coconut grove and a mangrove swamp along its 1.5 km length. Camboa is a Tupi word
						that means “calm waters”. It is located at the river mouth of the Ipojuca River. The reefs form
						a natural pool of calm and shallow water at low tide. The trip to Camboa also allows you to
						observe the Port of Suape and Recife. Access to this beach must be by buggy, or on foot from
						Muro Alto.
					</p>
					<p>
						CUPE
						Cupe beach brings together sports practitioners, visitors looking for the tranquility of natural
						pools and ecological tourism enthusiasts. On the right side there are no reefs, which allows
						surfing with strong and constant waves. On the other side, the reefs form little-known natural
						pools that never dry out much. Another distinctive feature is that, in some places, Cupe allows
						you to see the birth of sea turtles since it is a spawning and hatching point for eggs. Cupe is
						between Muro Alto and Porto de Galinhas, and can be accessed via the PE-09 highway.
					</p>
					<p>
						ENSEADINHA
						Enseadinha beach is on the other side of Pontal de Maracaípe. The beach is similar to its
						neighbor since it has coral reefs, calm waves, and mangrove vegetation. It is possible to bathe
						in the river and the sea areas and take a raft, boat, and kayak trips. Enseadinha can be
						accessed from Pontal on foot during low tide. Another way to get there, also on foot, is from
						Serrambi beach, where there are taxis and buggies to get back to Porto de Galinhas.
					</p>
					<p>
						MARACAÍPE
						Maracaípe beach is known as the surfers' paradise. It hosts national and international
						championships in the sport because of the high waves and clear waters. This makes her dangerous
						for bathing, but the young crowd makes the atmosphere relaxed and conducive to flirting. With
						bars that serve meals and snacks, Maracaípe also has many concerts in the summer. The beach name
						comes from two Tupi words: maracá means sound and ípe means river, which forms the expression
						“the sound of the river”.
					</p>
					<p>
						MURO ALTO
						This beach is for families with children because of the natural pools formed between the sand
						and a coral barrier. The dammed-up, crystal-clear, warm water becomes a waveless, saltwater lake
						where children can play without worries, in the water or small sailing boats and kayaks. With 3
						km long, Muro Alto is one of the beaches that offers the best infrastructure to the guest, with
						hotels and resorts. From the beach, it is also possible to hire a buggy ride to Pontal de
						Maracaípe.
					</p>
					<p>
						PONTAL DE MARACAÍPE
						At the end of Maracaípe begins Pontal, a beach with a strip of sand for walking, coral banks,
						calm seas, and many coconut trees. Although at first glance it seems just a place for
						contemplation, Pontal de Maracaípe has many activities. There are kitesurfing lessons,
						speedboat, kayak, raft trips to see seahorses and swimming, hiking along trails, and kiosks of
						bars and restaurants that serve lunch. Pontal brings together the beach, the mouth of the
						Maracaípe River, and the mangrove in the same place. Perfect for watching the sunset, the place
						also has nightlife in Vila de Todos os Santos, a complex of bars and restaurants.
					</p>
					<p>
						SERRAMBI
						Neighboring Maracaípe, Serrambi is a quiet beach with a good service structure. A perfect place
						to rest and relax in the natural pools and take a walk in the late afternoon. Once there, it is
						worth going up to Igreja do Outeiro to have the best view of the city. In Serrambi there is also
						space for water sports such as surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, speedboat rides, jet skiing and
						autonomous diving. One of the tours takes you to the island of Santo Aleixo, where you can see
						shipwrecks.
					</p>
					<p>
						TOQUINHO
						Toquinho is a beach not well-known by tourists. It has a barrier reef, white and beaten sand,
						natural pools, and stretches of rough seas. The name comes from the coconut stumps, as the
						region had a fruit farm in the 70s. In the surroundings there are luxury condominiums and bars
						that serve snacks, drinks, and coconut water. The beach is the last in the region and is bounded
						by the Sirinhaém River, which separates Ipojuca from the municipality of Tamandaré.
					</p>

				<h2>TOURIST ACTIVITIES</h2>
				<div class="description-one">
					<p>


						VISITING THE BAOBAB
						Possibly planted by African slaves, the baobab is a tree that became a tourist attraction in
						Porto de Galinhas. Being approximately 400 years old (it can reach a thousand years), the
						largest specimen in the region has a 4.5 meters trunk in diameter and is located on Rua do
						Colégio, in the district of Nossa Senhora do Ó, which is 11 km from Porto de Galinhas and 100
						meters from Nossa Senhora do Ó church. The visit to the site also provides a history lesson from
						the time when Brazil was discovered by Portugal.
					</p>
					<p>
						BUGGY RIDES
						In addition to Porto de Galinhas, the municipality of Ipojuca has eleven beaches. Some of those
						beaches are almost deserted, to which access is made by buggy through trails in the soft sand.
						During the tour, visitors can admire beautiful landscapes while feeling the wind hitting their
						faces. The most common one is called Ponta a Ponta, which takes tourists to the beaches of Cupe,
						Muro Alto, Maracaípe, and Pontal de Maracaípe. There are hundreds of buggy drivers that can be
						hired through hotels in the region.
					</p>
					<p>
						CANOEING IN THE MANGROVE
						Another way of admiring the exotic beauty of the mangrove is the kayak tour. The route starts at
						Mangue Jump and heads towards the mouth of the Maracaípe River. The visitor passes through the
						region of Feitera village and stops at Prainha before reaching the main point of the route: the
						meeting of the river with the ocean. The tour is organized by Pé no Mangue Ecoturismo e
						Aventura.
					</p>
					<p>
						NAUTICAL AND EXTREME SPORTS
						If Maracaípe beach is a stronghold for surfers due to its waves that reach 2.5 meters high, in
						neighboring Pontal de Maracaípe the strong winds favor the practice of kitesurfing, in which a
						board is pulled by a kite. The sport of French origin mixes techniques of free flight,
						windsurfing, water skiing, and surfing. To use the “flying boards” you need specialized
						training, offered by the Pernambuco Kitesurf School. It is also possible to practice
						windsurfing, kayaking, and even riding a speedboat and jet skis.
					</p>
					<p>
						MANGROVE
						During the 40-minute raft ride that leaves Pontal do Maracaípe, the raftsmen of the Pontal
						Association show visitors the rich vegetation of the mangrove roots.
					</p>
					<p>
						DIVING
						Coral reefs, rock formations, and shipwrecks are attractions that visitors can only see
						underwater. The best time for diving is from October to March when water visibility conditions
						reach ten meters on the reefs near the beach and 25 meters in the open sea. In the region, there
						are options such as free diving with mask, snorkel, fins, and vest, baptism with instructors and
						guides, and also basic and advanced courses offered by several diving operators.
					</p>
					<p>
						NATURAL POOLS
						Natural pools are common throughout the northeastern coast, but in Porto de Galinhas they are
						closer to the coast, just five minutes from the beach on a raft trip. The natural pools, formed
						by the coral reefs during low tide, allow the sensation of being in a real aquarium full of
						colorful fish. Some are so close that it is possible to explore them on foot at low tide, taking
						care to wear sandals because of the sea urchins. The tour is offered by the Associação dos
						Jangadeiros, at Praça das Piscinas Naturais.
