					Recife has been making strides in developing its technology industry in recent years. The city has become known as a hub for tech startups and entrepreneurship, with a growing number of companies focusing on software development, information technology (IT), and digital media.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the key factors driving this growth is the presence of several technology parks, such as Porto Digital and C.E.S.A.R., which provide infrastructure and support services for tech startups and established companies alike. These technology parks have been instrumental in attracting investment and fostering innovation in the region. Recife houses more than two hundred companies, including multinationals such as Accenture, Oracle, ThoughtWorks, Ogilvy, IBM, and Microsoft. The Porto Digital is recognized by A. T. Kearny as the largest technology park in Brazil in terms of revenue and number of companies, contributing 3.5% of Pernambuco's GDP. The capital of Pernambuco also stands out in technological education. As an example, The Informatics Center of the Federal University of Pernambuco (CIn-UFPE), considered one of the main academic centers in informatics in Latin America and responsible for Computer Science, Information Systems, and Computer Engineering courses, is a major supplier of labor specialized in technology for multinationals in the sector. The University of Pernambuco and Catholic University of Pernambuco are renowned institutions in technological education.
